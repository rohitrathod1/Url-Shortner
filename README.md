## üìÇ Key Project Architecture

The project adheres to the standard Next.js App Router structure:

| Path | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `app/layout.jsx` | Root Layout & Global CSS | Defines the `<html>` and `<body>`, sets global fonts, and applies the dark theme baseline. |
| `app/page.jsx` | Home Landing Page | Static marketing page with core value propositions and primary Call to Action (CTA). |
| `app/shorten/page.jsx` | Link Shortening Interface | The client-side form logic for input, validation, and API interaction (using `useState` and `fetch`). |
| `app/api/generate/route.js` | API Endpoint | Handles the POST request, validates the URL, interacts with the database to save the mapping, and returns the short link. |
| `components/Navbar.jsx` | Navigation Component | Fully responsive, sticky header with dynamic link styling. |
